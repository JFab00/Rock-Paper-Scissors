# [Highschool Projects] Rock Paper Scissors

To be fair, if you ask me do recode this I wouldn't be able to...  
First of all we had to be in group of 3, and the topic of this project was to create a simple multiplayer game (we had to choose which game to create, we chose RPS) that works only on the same computer (more like co-op games).  
Even if the project was to be made by a three-persons group, I have offered to my classmates to make the project by myself, while they'll be staying on discord with me suggesting me things (or if not, at least to stay me and not feel alone)... Either way I thank both of them for cooperating, since most of the times when I didn't understand why something wasn't working, they would get involved and try to solve the problem with me.  

# Requirements

The project could have been done in two ways, through C# or through JS (we first did the C# one, and later also did the JS one for a mark increase).  
You could choose between SOAP and REST architecture, if I'm not wrong, we did both of them in REST (if I'm wrong then sorry, I don't really remember this stuff).  
First of all, we had to create a login and register interface... If you didn't have an account then you had to register (by clicking on the "Register" label that was under the "Login" button)... when actually registering, the details were stored in an XML file that acted as a database...  
After login, you would get redirected to the menu interface that had 3 buttons, PLAY, STATS and QUIT (the STATS one was a feature added by us just for fun).  
When PLAY was clicked, it should add you to a queue till it finds you a player to play against with.

# Video

I actually remember having a problem with this project... I don't know if it was this the reason or not, but that was the only thing we found...  
My Visual Studio was set in english, so the dates were stored in MM/DD/YYYY format, but when I passed the project to my schoolmates it didn't work because they had it in italian and was reading the dates as DD/MM/YYYY... so if the date was something like 5/22/2020, then it would give an error since the month 22 doesn't exists...  
So just to be sure, I made a video for my teacher in which I showed the code and tested the project and showed him that it works, just to make sure he won't get upset if it didn't work (he wouldn't have got upset either way, he was a really nice person)  
Anyway here's the video:

From what I remember it isn't working as it should, since when you login you are directly added to the queue... that isn't really that good  
Either way I think we got a 7.5 on the C# project...  
If you want to update the code, be my guest...  
If you need this for your projects, take it... but make sure you understand the code... because I don't understand it anymore (:
